            <h1>Saul Galaviz</h1><br>
            <p>My background is in computer science. I recently completed my undergrad at Cal Poly Pomona and realized that I wanted to get my hands
            working on Front End and Back End technologies. Now after having graduated, I’m pushing myself to learn such industry technologies which 
            were not taught to me during my undergrad. I’m currently learning industry tools and applying it towards projects, such as having pushed 
            this portfolio online.</p><br><br>

            <p><strong>Cal Poly Pomona Ignite · High School Tutor · 2018-01 – 2019-05</strong><br>
                Ex-Google sponsored club at Cal Poly Pomona, focused on introducing computer science principles to students at earlier ages in nearby 
                schools. Lessons for tutoring mainly involved MIT’s APP Inventor, but other times Python and Arduino Robots were involved.<br>
                Tutored in the high school group. Tutoring students included presentations as well as face to face.</p>
